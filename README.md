<h5> About the Lab : </h5>

	The Software Engineering Lab is aimed to provide you hands-on experience with different aspects of Software Engineering and UML including requirements identification, DFD, behavioral and structural design using UML diagrams, implementation, testing, and so on. 
	Throughout the semester, you will be working on these aspects of an assigned project to get a feel of the real-life software development process.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

	The collaboration diagram is used to show the relationship between the objects in a system. 
	Both the sequence and the collaboration diagrams represent the same information but differently. 
	Instead of showing the flow of messages, it depicts the architecture of the object residing in the system as it is based on object-oriented programming. 
	An object consists of several features. Multiple objects present in the system are connected to each other. 
	The collaboration diagram, which is also known as a communication diagram, is used to portray the object's architecture in the system.
	A state diagram is used to represent the condition of the system or part of the system at finite instances of time. 
	It’s a behavioral diagram and it represents the behavior using finite state transitions. 
	State diagrams are also referred to as State machines and State-chart Diagrams. 
	These terms are often used interchangeably. 
	So simply, a state diagram is used to model the dynamic behavior of a class in response to time and changing external stimuli. 
	We can say that each and every class has a state but we don’t model every class using State diagrams. 
	We prefer to model the states with three or more states.
